### Notes:

##### androidtranslator.rb
Is a ruby script written to produce transaltions files from the csv file of the responses to the google docs form. There is also a small piece of Google App script which put the right two letter code in the last cell of each response if anyone would like it just ask.

Note: This script makes use of bash so is Linux and Mac only.
